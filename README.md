# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Word-Embeddings-and-TF-IDF
This project uses a neural network for sentiment analysis. Text data is converted to lowercase, vectorized with TF-IDF, and classified using a feedforward neural network. K-Fold Cross-Validation, Adam optimizer, and Binary Cross-Entropy loss are used for training, with validation accuracy printed for each fold.
